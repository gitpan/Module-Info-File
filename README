README file for Module::Info::File

$Id: README,v 1.1 2003/09/28 09:25:04 jonasbn Exp $

In the beginning I was using Module::Info, but due to a lacking
functionality in this module I created Module::Info::File, which
inherits from Module::Info and replaces the B<new_from_file> method so
the lacking data can be accessed. Apart from that you can use all the
neat accessors from Module::Info.

In the bin folder in this distibution is a small script called
version.pl, which was the beginning of everything.
