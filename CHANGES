0.04 Released 10th. January 2004

- Update bin/version.pl with $VERSION number, I think this is a
  requirement for scripts in the scripts section on CPAN

- Added File::Spec to Makefile.PL

- Fixed a few bugs in bin/version.pl (I think I must have lost a
  version at some point)

- Added handling of .pl scripts

0.05 Released 28th. of February 2004

- Updated bin/version.pl with POD required to have the script in the
  CPAN scripts directory (http://www.cpan.org/scripts/). The script was
  uploaded alone to PAUSE together with the release of 0.04

- Added handling of directories so it is possible to get version numbers of all
  perl modules in a directory recursively with bin/version.pl
  
- Added INSTALL file

- Makefile.PL had a makeover

0.06 Not yet released

- Patched with patch from LTHEGLER, should now work under 5.005_03, open was
  using the unecessary 3 arguments instead of just two.
