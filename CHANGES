CHANGES file for Module::Info::File

$Id: CHANGES 1709 2007-02-13 19:41:16Z jonasbn $

0.10 Released Tue Feb 13 2007

- Bugfix release, a mistake I made before, when letting Module::Build create
  the Makefile.PL is auto includes the bin directory, but with a full path
  referring to a path on the Build host.
  
  I have renamed bin/version.pl to script/version.pl and added it to Build.PL
  so not the Makefile.PL is generated correctly
  
  From Build.PL:
  
  scripts => {
	  'script/version.pl'   => 'script/version.pl',
  },

  From Makefile.PL:
  
  'EXE_FILES' => [
				 'script/version.pl'
			   ],


0.09 Released Mon Feb 12 2007

- Added a Perl::Critic test t/critic.t (courtesy of Jeffrey Ryan Thalhammer, 
  Test::Perl::Critic)

- Refactored parts of the code, mostly regular expressions - all tests pass

- Ran code through perltidy aswell (level 1 perlcritic warning)

- Ran code through Perl::Critic all the way to level1 and updated POD and code
  accordingly after reading the referenced sections in PBP - they all made
  perfect sense 
  
  Checked with Lars Thegler on the use of 2 vs. 3 argument version of open and
  since FreeBSD 4.x is declared EoL, Perl 5.6.x is the official version and 
  compability for older perl is no longer required, if somebody would require
  this I would be willing to invest the time and effort

- Fixed a bug reported by  Eric D. Peterson, he experienced problems with 
  traversing all his packages and getting the information using new_from_file()
  
  Apparently the DBD::Oracle has a closure in which the package is defined.
  See: Oracle::DBD, t/oracle_package_bug.t and drafts/OracleLikePackage.pm for
  an example
  
  I have changed the package matching regular expression, considering using PPI
  it might however be serious overkill.

- Changed from ExtUtils::MakeMaker to Module::Build

- Added a Kwalitee test t/kwalitee.t (courtesy of chromatic, Test::Kwalitee)

- Added a test more to t/File.t


0.08 Released 13th. of November 2004

 - Improved the VERSION locating regular expression

 - Added use of Carp (also added in Makefile.PL)

 - Added t/00_load.t

 - Removed Multipackage files (no longer at part of the distribution)

 - new_from_file no longer supports list context, I have readded this to the 
   TODO, since the implementation in 0.07 was not good, so multiple
   package definitions in files are no longer handled.

 - Fixed serious bug in the setting of the version number, this bug only occurred 
   on Linux boxes running Perl 5.8.4.

 - Added some better exception handling to the version.pl script

 - Added some more debug information to the version.pl script

 - Turned this CHANGES file upside down

 - Added CPAN testers to the ACKNOWLEDGE section

 - Added version_bug.t to t/ (not in distribution)

0.07 Released 19th. of September 2004

- Added list context for constructor (new_from_file)

- bin/version.pl updated to accomodate this

0.06 Released 23rd. of July 2004

- Patched with patch from LTHEGLER, should now work under 5.005_03, open was
  using the unecessary 3 arguments instead of just two.

0.05 Released 28th. of February 2004

- Updated bin/version.pl with POD required to have the script in the
  CPAN scripts directory (http://www.cpan.org/scripts/). The script was
  uploaded alone to PAUSE together with the release of 0.04

- Added handling of directories so it is possible to get version numbers of 
  all perl modules in a directory recursively with bin/version.pl
  
- Added INSTALL file

- Makefile.PL had a makeover

0.04 Released 10th. January 2004

- Updated bin/version.pl updated with error handling

- Update bin/version.pl with $VERSION number, I think this is a
  requirement for scripts in the scripts section on CPAN

- Added File::Spec to Makefile.PL

- Fixed a few bugs in bin/version.pl (I think I must have lost a
  version at some point)

- Added handling of .pl scripts

- Added a warning in the case where script is not a .pl or .pm

0.03 Released 20th. December 20 2003

- POD cleaned and reviewed by Rias.

- ACKNOWLEDGE section added

- Added information to t/Info.t so if the Module::Info tests fail, the
  test asks the tester to mail me the information

0.02 Released 3rd. November 2003

- Added TODO file

- Added Changes file (this file)

- Added description to NAME section

- Added use of File::Basename to make test on Win32 work

- Fixed bug (rt: #4147) - broken tests on Win32

0.01 Released 30th. September 2003
